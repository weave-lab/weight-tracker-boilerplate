This project is a starting point for the weight tracker sample application.

# The Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple react application with 2 pages. The app allows multiple users to track their weight over time. There is no need to implement authentication or authorization. Feel free to use basic styling libraries or roll your own. You are also able to add 3rd Party libraries for things such as charting if you desire. It is perfectly accpetable to use localstorage to save the data if you do not want to implement a backend. Be creative! Show us what you got!

## Note

Please include some sample data so that the app is not empty to begin with. For example, 2 users with 10 weight measurements each.

## Users Page

The users page should display a list of users. The list shows basic information about the user such as name, age, and current weight. The page should also allow you to create a new user. 

Selecting a user from the list takes you to the weight page for that user.

## Weight Page

The weight page displays the users name, current weight, and any other information you would like in a meaningful way at the top of the page. It also displays a graph of a users weight over time. This can be a simple line chart or something more complex if you have a better idea.

You also need to be able to add a new weight for the user. This can be as simple as adding their weight for a specific day or as complex as reading in a csv. 


# Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
